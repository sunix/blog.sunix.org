Hi everyone ! I'm starting my new blog site. In this first blog post, we are going to detail all the steps to create you own blog site with
Jekyll, Github Pages, Docker, Eclipse Che cloud IDE and Codenvy.

<!-- more -->
and more and more

You can right away help me in improving this blog site by clicking on this link [![open in IDE]({{ site.url }}/images/contribute.svg)](https://codenvy.com/f?id=k307cp4ad7ib5gex).
If this is the first time, pay attention to the blocked popup: please authorize `codenvy.com` to popup dialog boxes, go back the this page and click again on this link.
The link will open the blog site project in a temporary workspace at Codenvy. You will then be able to submit your changes as Github pull requests.
Thanks in advance for your contribution!

For the next blog post, I will explain how to create this kind of link for your Github project.



## 1. Tools in action: Jekyll, Github Pages, Che, Codenvy, Docker

### Websites hosted by Github: Github Pages
Github offers free website hosting. This is called Github Pages.
Hosting website with Github Pages has some advantages:

- It's free.
- It's maintained by Github. We won't need to deal with upgrades of your server, down times, etc.
- It's versionned with Git. Track all your changes.
- We don't depend on Github. If Github stop Pages service, it won't be a problem to host the site elsewhere.

With Github Pages, each site is actually a Github project. You can use it for your full static website or use the available Jekyll blog site generator.

### What is Jekyll?
Github Pages comes with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll is "a simple, blog aware, static site generator".
It takes markdown files and template files as input and merges them to generate a static site.
Thus, there is no database to deal with, no security issue, no performance issue.
For our blog site, we are going to create our site on a new Github project. A Jekyll project is composed of several folders prefixed by `_`:

  - `_includes` contains headers, footers, menus, sidebars to be included in your pages
  - `_layouts` contains the template files
  - `_posts` contains your blog posts files
  - `_sass` contains scripted CSS using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)

All theses folders are templates or sass css that will be use to generate the static site. If you have any folders not starting with `_`, these ones won't change and stay statics.

For Github Pages sites, Github will regenerate the site with Jekyll each time a modification is done in your Git project.

### Docker
Docker is a container technology. As opposed to virtualisation (Virtual box or VMWare), containers are lightweight:
containers use isolated and native host processes. When a Docker image is running, all the processes are actually running on the host machine.
Thus, Docker can run only machines based on the operating system kernel. For instance, you can run any linux distribution on a Docker hosted by linux.
Docker offer a way to write and build images based on recipe with inheritance capabilities. You write how to build an image providing linux command to run.
Typically, we will run commands using `apt-get install` or `wget http://archive.zip && unzip archive.zip` to build our images.
Docker is a nice tool for developers as it describes a reproductible way to build an image. You can share the recipe of your Docker image and use Git to
keep all the change history of this file. It's like you have the source code of your virtual machine.

### Eclipse Che hosted by Codenvy
When writing our blog post, we may not want to publish the site to 'production' each time you make a change just to see how it looks.
To test the site before publishing it, we could install Jekyll locally on our computer and run the site generation locally for testing.
However, installing Jekyll is not that easy. Ruby, NodeJS and gem are required and the installation steps may differ from one system to another.
Plus, we want to have our editing environement available from anywhere.
We are going to use an [Eclipse Che](http://eclipse.org/che) hosted by [Codenvy](http://codenvy.com). Eclipse Che is a Cloud IDE and we will use it to edit our blog site,
test it and push the changes to Github.
Codenvy provides a Docker infrastructure on the cloud to run your applications. You don't have to install anything: everything will be available from a browser.
We will be able to create our Docker recipe, generate and run our Jekyll site ... from anywhere, with any device.

## 2. Choose a theme
Let's start creating our blog site. First of all, we won't start from scratch but reuse a existing Jekyll theme to bootstrap our site.
In the site [http://jekyllthemes.org/](http://jekyllthemes.org/), we can find a lot of theme for Jekyll. The site samples are complete and ready to use.
As far as I'm concerned, I've chosen this one: [Freshman21](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/freshman21/).

## 3. Fork Jekyll theme in your Github
Once log in [Github.com](http://github.com), we will fork the `Freshman21` project.
You can fork it from [https://github.com/yulijia/freshman](https://github.com/yulijia/freshman21).

![fork]({{ site.url }}/images/github_fork.png)

![fork choose]({{ site.url }}/images/github_fork_choose.png)

![forked]({{ site.url }}/images/github_forked.png)


### Main website
With Github Pages, a site can be served directly from `http://yourgithubname.github.io` or `http://yourgithubname.github.io/asitename`
If this is going to be your main site, rename it `yourgithubname.github.io`. The site will be available in `http://yourgithubname.github.io/`.
If not, Github will use the branch `gh-pages` that will be used by Github Pages.
The site will be available at `http://yourgithubname.github.io/githubProjectName/`.

Freshman21 themes already include both branches. In this project, they represent 2 differents versions of the site (with and without javascript).
You can try the result of the forked theme right away [http://yourgithubname.github.io/freshman21](http://yourgithubname.github.io/freshman21).

## 4. Import in Codenvy Eclipse Che
In [Codenvy](http://codenvy.com) website, log in with your Github account and import the forked project.

![import]({{ site.url }}/images/dashboard_import.png)

![import from github]({{ site.url }}/images/dashboard_from_github.png)

![dashboard project]({{ site.url }}/images/dashboard_project.png)

Open (double click) the project.

Normally Eclipse Che should ask to configure your project. Configure the project by choosing `blank` as project type.

![configure]({{ site.url }}/images/project_configure.png)

![blank]({{ site.url }}/images/project_blank.png)

At that point, we should have the IDE opened with the freshman21 project.

### gh-pages branch
if the site is going to be your main Github Pages site, you can skip this part.
Otherwise, from the `Git > Branches ...` menu action, checkout the branch `gh-pages`.

![che branches]({{ site.url }}/images/che_branches.png)

![che create and checkout]({{ site.url }}/images/che_checkout.png)


## 5. Test in Codenvy
To test the site before pushing it, we can run the jekyll generator with a custom Docker runner.

Create a new Custom Runner in `Runners` - `Configs` tab,  create a new configuration.

![che runner create]({{ site.url }}/images/che_runner_create.png)

Rename it `Jekyll`.

![che runner jekyll]({{ site.url }}/images/che_runner_jekyll.png)

Paste this content:


{% highlight Dockerfile %}
FROM sunix/jekyll4che

ENV CODENVY_APP_BIND_DIR /home/user/app
VOLUME ["/home/user/app"]

USER root
WORKDIR /home/user/app

CMD echo 'url: "http://'$CODENVY_HOSTNAME':'$CODENVY_PORT_4000'"' >> _config.yml && \
    echo 'baseurl: ""' >> _config.yml && \
    jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}

Save and start the runner. Once started, the running site link should be available.
![che runner run]({{ site.url }}/images/che_runner_run.png)

![che runner link]({{ site.url }}/images/che_runner_link.png)

![che runner app]({{ site.url }}/images/che_runner_app.png)


### Use Dockerhub prebuilt images to speed up
We use [sunix/jekyll4che](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/sunix/jekyll4che/dockerfile/) image that's been built by Dockerhub.
If not cached, instead of executing all the steps to install the application,
it will download a prebuilt image and speed up the startup of our application. 

[sunix/jekyll4che](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/sunix/jekyll4che/dockerfile/) looks like:

{% highlight Dockerfile %}
FROM codenvy/shellinabox
RUN sudo apt-get update && \
    sudo apt-get upgrade -y && \
    sudo apt-get install -y ruby ruby-dev patch nodejs python locales && \
    sudo gem install github-pages
RUN sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales && \
  sudo locale-gen C.UTF-8 && \
  sudo /usr/sbin/update-locale LANG=C.UTF-8
ENV LC_ALL C.UTF-8
ENV LANG en_US.UTF-8
ENV LANGUAGE en_US.UTF-8
EXPOSE 4000
ENV CODENVY_APP_PORT_4000_HTTP 4000
{% endhighlight %}

### Mounting volume instead of copying sources
Right away, you can try the generated site by clicking on the link just below the runner panel. We didn't use the `ADD` comment

{% highlight Dockerfile %}ADD $app_src$ /home/user/app/{% endhighlight %}

But the `VOLUME` Docker command to mount sources. This way, modifications are live updated on runners. FYI, changes done on `_config.yml` won't get
reloaded. You will need to restart the Docker runner.


### Overriding url configuration at runtime
The last lines of the Dockerfile override the baserurl and the url so that the site works well when running on Eclipse Che Docker AND on Github Pages.

## 6. Customisation

### Create a new blog post
First, remove all the blog posts files that are coming with the theme in `_posts` folder.

To create a new blog post, create a new .md file in the `_posts` folder.
The file should start with headers:

    ---
    layout: post
    title: A blog site with Jekyll, Github pages Eclipse Che and Codenvy
    modified: 2015-01-11
    categories: [articles, Howto]
    tags: 
      - blog
      - jekyll
      - codenvy
      - eclipse che
      - github pages
    comments: true
    ---
    ## Your first blog post !
    hello world

Then you can write traditional text using the markdown syntax. You have written your first blog post!

I really recommand you to read this [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) for your first blog post.

### Site configuration
`_config.yml` contains all the site configuration that you may want to customize. Here are the ones I have changed:

  - title: The title (html) of the site. The title is also displayed on top of each page.
  - tagline: A description of the site, will be display in h3 between the title and the menu
  - author: Your name. Will be displayed in the 'about me' page
  - email: Your email.
  - description: It will appear in your document head meta and in your feed.xml site
  - keywords: the keywords
  - baseurl: the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/. if this is not your main page, it should be the name of your Github project.
  - url: should be http://yourusername.github.io
  - twitter_username
  - github_username
  - disqus_shortname: subcribe to disqus, register your website and get comments on your site
  - aboutme: about you
  - aboutme_photo: url to your photo
  - google_analytics_key: put YOUR key here to enable tracking! (blank to disable)


## 7. Push to Github
Once we are happy, with our site, we would like to push our changes to Github.
First commit your changes:
  - select the new and modified files and select the menu action: `Git > Add to index...`
  - commit your changes `Git > Commit...`
  
Push your changes to Github `Git > Remotes... > Push...`

You should normally have your changes pushed on your project and your website updated.


## 8. DNS Github Pages setup
If you have your own DNS, create a new CNAME file and add your DNS name on it. As far as I'm concerned, I have a CNAME file with:

    blog.sunix.org

And I have added a new CNAME entry in my DNS configure at Gandi:

    Type: CNAME
    TTL: 3 hours
    Name: blog
    Value: sunix.github.io.

Also I've updated `_config.yml` url and base url:

    baseurl: ""
    url: "http://blog.sunix.org"

## 9. Comments with disqus
By default, the Jekyll theme comes with an integration to disqus. You can create an account on disqus and update the `_config.yml` accordingly.

Once logged on disqus, you can add disqus to your site from the menu action `Add Disqus To Site`.
![disqus add to site]({{ site.url }}/images/disqus_add_to_site.png)

Fill your site name and the short name (will be used for the unique disqus URL).
![disqus config]({{ site.url }}/images/disqus_creation.png)

Finally update your _config.yml file with your disqus shortname

    disqus_shortname: sunix

From now, people will be able to add comments on your blog posts.

## Done !

That's all, don't hesitate to make any comments and improve this blog post :) thank YOU for reading.
