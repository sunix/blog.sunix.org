# Java Software Engineer

Sun Seng David Tan

## Summary

### Java
I have 10 years of experience as a Java developer. In addition, I have worked for software vendors such as Nuxeo, Thales in Paris, and Economic Outlook in Australia.

### FOSS
I am fortunate to have had an opportunity to work with Nuxeo, an open source software vendor. For its many advantages, I am very inclined to continue working with and promoting the use of Free and Open Source Softwares.
I am currently an Eclipse committer for the Eclipse Che project.

### Tooling
I believe that improving his own tools is part of the job of every developer. It's a long term investment but it's worth it.
I've been involved in the development of the Codenvy Cloud IDE platform including Eclipse CHE extensions.
I've also been involved in improving Nuxeo IDE plugin for Eclipse IDE when working on Nuxeo Platform.
Bash and now Docker are my best friends for speeding my everyday tasks.

### Eclipse RCP
While working at Nuxeo and Economic Outlook over 6 years, I gained valuable experience while working on and contributing to projects with Eclipse RCP.

### Nuxeo
As a Nuxeo core developer and trainer, I position myself as a "Nuxeo expert".

### Agile developer
I am fond of TDD and BDD and believe that even documentations should be the result of tests.
In addition, I also have experience as a SCRUM master at Nuxeo.

### Training
As one of the main trainers at Nuxeo, I have a great opportunity to share my knowledge with other people, especially my team mates, which is a responsibility that I enjoy having.
